## Keep Calm And Run Linux

Larry Ewing's original Tux drawing, created with The GIMP in 1996, is used in this design. (See more details on the Tux mascot here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tux_%28mascot%29)

You're allowed to make your own prints and/or modify the design. I'd appreciate,  if you'd write me a line, but you're not required to do so.
